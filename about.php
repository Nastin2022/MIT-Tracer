    <p> The University was established to provide high-quality tertiary education for the country’s ever-increasing number of secondary school leavers.

 

At the time of formation, Nile University had three faculties (Arts & Social Sciences, Engineering, and Natural & Applied Sciences) and 93 students.

 

As the University grew and thrived over the following years, the need to provide its high-quality instruction at a higher level became increasingly apparent. </p>
